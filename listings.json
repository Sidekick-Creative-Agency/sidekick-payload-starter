    "PublicRemarks": "Perhaps the most inspired residence in all of Wacotown, this exceptional, architecturally significant property leaves nothing to be desired inside or out!     ---     Penned by acclaimed Wacoan, Robert S. Bennett (whose own, personal residence was just down the street), the primary home recently underwent a comprehensive remodel which saw significant improvements and upgrades to all systems and all surfaces. Careful thought was given to preservation of the home's iconic aesthetic so as to draw inspiration from, but not completely reimagine, the impressive and original design language. In keeping with that tradition, enhancements were deliberate and intentional so that attention was paid in keeping with the true, mid-century modern language that's so revered and sought after (but ultra uncommon in Central Texas).     ---     The main residence, which is seemingly tucked into the hillside from the front entry, reveals boundless natural light from the home&#x2019;s floor to ceiling windows which span the entire back of the home.  As part of the remodel, the central kitchen underwent the most dramatic transformation with its removal of walls, installation of beautiful book matched cabinetry and full array of chef approved Thermador appliances, and creation of the massive island which perfectly accommodates &#x201C;eat in&#x201D; capabilities.  Not to be outdone by the glorious professional kitchen, the sunken living room is adorned with custom, period railing, and the home&#x2019;s bathrooms superbly strike a balance between beauty and function in settings which are easily confused with the most decadent of health spas.      ---     To further ameliorate the home's appeal, a 494 square foot casita was built from the ground up. Here, a full one bedroom, one bathroom guest home adds a full kitchen, laundry room, and living space which perfectly compliments the original home's 2,088 square foot, two bedroom, two bathroom layout.    ---     As if the elevated design and attractive material selections ",

A flexible office space, which can double as the fourth bedroom, is downstairs.  That office/bedroom enjoys access to a full bathroom while the primary suite sits across a hallway so that it&#x2019;s convenient and accessible whilst still retaining privacy and seclusion.

Here, another fireplace sits proudly, greeting entrants with a warm ambiance.  In front of the living room, the home&#x2019;s office sits across from the formal dining room.     -----     Both rooms can serve dual purposes with the office easily converting to a bathroom while the formal dining room is almost redundant, thus allowing it to transform to a sitting area, parlor, or even game room thanks to the oversized breakfast area.",

It's what gives this home its edge over most other footprints in this neighborhood. It also features a split bedroom arrangement with all secondary bedrooms on the opposite side of the home from the primary. What's even better is that there is a separate \"flex space\" that could function as a 5th bedroom, a home office, a theatre, a home school room, formal dining, craft space or extra storage - whatever your special needs are! Recent updates are the kitchen sink with power cup rinser and in-sink colander, new oversized shower with sliding doors, and fresh paint! Located just a few minutes from the expanding TSTC campus and 7 minutes from Downtown Waco. A must see on your spring home shopping list!",

What was once the Dean family farm is now home to some of Waco's most architecturally significant residences, a prominent church, exceptional school, and of course, our very own Waco Police Department. --- Revered for its large lots and alleyways which provide a buffer between backyard neighbors, homes within the neighborhood are celebrated for this individuality and unique appeal with each property distinctive in its own right. --- Here, after a \"down to studs\" remodel by Waco's noted design firm, The McLeod Company, this jewel of Dean Highland celebrates the hallmark style of the era but offers new systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and more), modern fixtures, and updated finish out throughout the home. --- Boasting 2,192 square feet of well planned, exceptionally practical space, the home's three bedroom, two bathroom floorplan benefits from dual, sequestered living spaces, abundant natural light, rich materials, and a handsome color palette. Solving the age old issue with old homes, small bathrooms, a small kitchen, and non-existent closet space, The McLeod Company reimagined the floorplan so that now, storage is abundant, bathrooms are modern, and the kitchen is as spacious as many living rooms. --- Outside, the rare, almost impossible to find two car garage is not only present and accounted for, but oversized and able to handle most modern cars. The .38 lot offers multiple patios and sitting areas while the mature trees, new fence, and sprawling backyard are ready to be enjoyed by all family members, two and four legged alike. --- With Baylor",

Each bedroom offers generous square footage, and all bathrooms&#x2014;including a convenient half bath&#x2014;have been fully updated with finishes that balance style and longevity. Outside, the backyard is built for relaxation and entertaining alike. The pool is the centerpiece, surrounded by lush landscaping, grassy yard space, and mature trees that create a natural privacy buffer. Tucked just beyond, the pool house offers incredible versatility&#x2014;fully equipped with its own bathroom, making it ideal for guests, a home office, studio, or extended entertaining space. Additional highlights include new windows throughout, a side-entry garage, and a location that offers the feel of a tucked-away retreat, all while staying connected to the best of Waco.

It&#x2019;s one of those communities that just works - there&#x2019;s a catch-and-release pond, a walking path for quick morning loops or evening strolls, a playground, and even a little basketball spot. People wave. Neighbors chat. Kids ride bikes. It feels easy to be here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're only about 20 minutes from downtown Waco, Baylor, and Magnolia Market - but even closer to Waco Lake, the Brazos River, Camp Fimfo, and Hawaiian Falls and the Waco Wetlands. It&#x2019;s a solid spot if you like to get outside, but don&#x2019;t want to be far from your favorite boutique or grocery run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Inside, the layout just makes sense. The main living space is open and bright, great for winding down or having people over. The kitchen flows into the dining area, so no one's left out while dinner&#x2019;s going. All three bedrooms are upstairs - including a primary suite that gives you a little breathing room - and there&#x2019;s a half bath downstairs, which always comes in handy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The backyard? Manageable and usable. It&#x2019;s got space to toss a football, let the dog run, or fire up the grill on a weekend. Just enough to enjoy, not so much that it feels like work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you&#x2019;re looking for a home in Waco, Texas within the China Spring community, with good schools and a neighborhood that actually feels like a community - this might be the one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me know if you want to come take a look.

From the second you turn into the gated, crepe myrtle-line driveway, you'll know you've found your forever home.  Built with love from the ground up, the floor plan is designed to perfection.  You'll step inside and be welcomed by the formal dining, and your wow-factor will go into over-drive when you see the tall ceiling in the living room.  The kitchen and breakfast area is a cook's greatest vision, unfolding right before your eyes. There's an isolated, primary suite that you'll never want to leave.  With added space for a sitting area, or home office, as well as a door directly to the back porch and a massive walk-in closet, they've spared no expense.  Step down the hallway, and after you see the half bath and utility room, you can walk through the garage directly into the heated and cooled extra space, which could be a fourth bedroom or even an office, game room, or home gym.  Upstairs, there's two more bedrooms and another full bath, with a view that money can't buy.  Build your dreams here when you can step out back directly into the pasture.  With two large stock tanks, plenty of shade and mature trees, and a fantastic open pasture, we've bundled it all up in one pretty package.  Bring your dreams; leave with a smile.  You just found HOME.",

Particularly significant update to the primary bath where the partition wall creating a narrow 18-inch shower opening was removed, the shower was made larger and a custom glass enclosure was installed to show off the custom tiled shower pan and surrounds creating a more functional and beautiful space to prep for your day. The ensuite bath(cave) was opened further when the standard 24-inch door was replaced by a 48-inch french door allowing the bathroom to breathe. All new doors and hardware were added throughout the unit as well as new light fixtures. New cabinetry in the bathrooms with larger mirrors and bright daylight LED fixtures. Now... the kitchen! Yes, the kitchen was also gutted, not just painted over. All new custom wood cabinetry was added with a stainless steel farmhouse sink that matches the new sleek, modern vibe of the entire unit featuring timeless Navy Blue accents. New and additional bright daylight LED fixtures were added to the kitchen and the dining area (yes an actual dining space). That old display cabinet was transformed into a functional pantry - a much needed feature in these units. New, hand selected, thick slab granite countertops were cut and all new LG ThinQ smart appliances installed. Can't say enough about the work done on this space - OH! almost forgot to mention that all those nasty popcorn ceilings are GONE! I mean, I just couldn't put my student any other unit after seeing this one redone! It's a no-brainer!",

    "PublicRemarks": "You know that feeling when you walk into a house and it just clicks? Like the walls are whispering, 'Yeah, I could totally see the kids running through here after school'? That's 208 Woodlands Blvd. This isn't just a house&#x2014;it's a four-bedroom, two-bathroom haven with a fenced backyard large enough to add a pool, practice sports, and to let pets roam freely. And let's talk about that patio&#x2014;private, peaceful, and just begging for Saturday morning pancakes or an impromptu BBQ. (We've all had that neighbor who shows up uninvited with a six-pack. Here, you can actually want that.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Location? It's a Cheat Code.&#xD;&#xA;Tucked in a quiet pocket of Waco called Bellmead, where the streets are wide but the commute's short, this spot gives you the best of both worlds. La Vega ISD schools? Check&#x2014;think academic rep + Friday night lights energy. Need to sprint to H-E-B for a forgotten gallon of milk? You're less than ten minutes from... well, everything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additional details!&#xD;&#xA;Appliances stay: Fridge, microwave, range, dishwasher&#x2014;no playing 'Will the seller take the washer?' games here.&#xD;&#xA;Two-car garage: Because figuring out parking in Texas heat should not be part of your daily workout.&#xD;&#xA;Fresh paint: Neutral tones, so your 'I swear this teal accent wall will work' phase has a clean slate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So... When's Your Tour?&#xD;&#xA;Whenever you'd like! The property is vacant and ready to schedule a showing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S. That backyard? Perfect for a fire pit. Just saying!",

Picture yourself walking through the double front doors and stopping for a moment in the foyer while admiring the expansive views through a wall of windows across the entire living room. The formal dining room, kitchen, and breakfast area are all positioned to take advantage of the views and open to a large wooden deck that spans the length of the home - the perfect spot for watching the sunset over Lake Waco! Walk from your backyard all the way down to the water's edge! In addition, the large master suite is situated on the first floor with views of the lake and includes a large space for a walk-in closet, plumbing ready to go for a luxury bathroom with all the amenities you could want, and a study or office nook. Another bedroom suite with a full bath is also located on the first floor. Upstairs, there is a large landing (also with amazing lake views) which could easily serve as a second living area, 5th bedroom, office, home school classroom, or play area. Two additional bedrooms with space for two full bathrooms are also located upstairs. Very few properties are available with this kind of lake view from so many rooms in the house.
